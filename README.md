# Recruiting-Eagle-SW-perception

## 🚀 Functionalities

- ✅ Loading images and visualizing them.
- ✅ Applying color tresholding and geometric condition to detect cones.
- ✅ Extracting track edges.
- ✅ Using FAST and ORB algorithm to estimate the movement direction of the camera.

## ⭐ Improvements

- Using data from FAST algorithm to recognize cones.
- Using fps to calculate the translation in meters.
